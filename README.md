# ft_linear_regression
Program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradiant descent algorithm.
Normalize the dataset and adjusting learning rate over time speeds up training significantly. Bold driver algorithm is used to do so.
You can visualize the linear function. Records of losses and theta values are also displayed over time using matplotlib.
